# Lab03: Git and GitHub

The goal of this laboratory exercise is to learn more about the workflow involving Git/GitHub for version control both on the command line, through Git front ends such as Source Tree and via GitHub.

## Step 1. Creating a new repository on GitHub

First, we need to create a new repository on GitHub. Log into GitHub with the acocunt you've been using for this training. Click on the *Repository* tab. Next, the *New* button. Under *Repository name* give your new repository a name, such as `lab03-exercise`. Next, fill in a short description in the appropriate field. Make sure *Public* is selected because private repositories cost money. Then, make sure to select *Initialize this repository with a README*. Finally, select **Java** under *.gitignore*. Once you completed these steps press the *Create Repository* button. There, you've created your own repository.

Once you have finished creating your repository, copy the its URL using the *Clone* button.

## Step 2. Creating a git repository locally

Opening the project is simple. Select *Open* from the Welcome screen. Next, navigate to the location of the project on your computer and select the directory *lab02*. This should open the project in IntelliJ and you should be ready to run it.

## Step 3. Writing functions
